# Project Design and Organization Overview

## Advantages
1. **Separation of Concerns**: The project effectively separates different concerns, with scripts dedicated to specific tasks (e.g., UI, controllers, utilities).
2. **Modularity**: Functions are split across different files (e.g., `BoardController`, `LevelCondition`, `Utils`), supporting a modular and maintainable design.
3. **Effective Unity Integration**: Utilizes Unity's features, such as `ScriptableObject` for configurations and `MenuItem` for editor tools.
4. **Clean Code Practices**: The use of enums and dictionaries in managing item types and counts helps keep the code clean and efficient.

## Disadvantages
1. **Scattered Usings**: Inconsistent and potentially redundant using directives across files.
2. **Lack of Documentation**: The code lacks comments and documentation, making it less accessible for new developers.
3. **Tight Coupling**: Some classes, like `Board` and `GameManager`, are tightly coupled, complicating testing and maintenance.
4. **Complex BoardController**: The `BoardController` class handles multiple responsibilities, making it difficult to maintain.
5. **Magic Numbers**: Presence of magic numbers in the codebase reduces readability and maintainability.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Directory Structure**:
    - **Scripts**:
      - **Board**: `Board.cs`, `BonusItem.cs`
      - **Controllers**: `BoardController.cs`, `LevelCondition.cs`
      - **UI**: `UIPanelPause.cs`, `UIToggleSound.cs`
      - **Utilities**: `Utils.cs`
      - **Editor**: `MainToolMenu.cs`
      - **ScriptableObjects**: `ConfigScrtbObj.cs`
    - **Resources**: Prefabs, ScriptableObjects
    - **Scenes**: Scene files
    - **Prefabs**: Prefab files
2. **Code Documentation**:
    - Add XML comments to public methods and classes.
    - Include inline comments for complex logic.
3. **Refactor Common Logic**: Extract common logic into utility methods to reduce code duplication.
4. **Decouple Classes**: Use interfaces or abstract classes to reduce tight coupling.
5. **Refactor BoardController**: Simplify by breaking down into smaller, focused classes.
6. **Replace Magic Numbers**: Use named constants or configuration values for better readability.
